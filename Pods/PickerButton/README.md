PickerButton is subclass of UIButton that presents UIPickerView in keyboard.

## Concept

When PickerButton is tapped, it presents UIPickerView on UIKeyboard.

| PickerButton | inputView | inputAccessoryView |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| PickerButton is in conformity to [UIKeyInput](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uikeyinput). | PickerButton returns UIPickerView as [inputView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/1621092-inputview). | PickerButton returns UIToolBar as [inputAccessoryView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/1621119-inputaccessoryview). |

When selected row or component is changed, button title is automatically updated.


## Usage

PickerButton is almost same interface as UIPickerView.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet weak var button: PickerButton!

    let pickerValues: [String] = ["first", "second", "third"]

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        button.delegate = self
        button.dataSource = self
    }
}

extension ViewController: UIPickerViewDelegate, UIPickerViewDataSource {

    func pickerView(_ pickerView: UIPickerView, titleForRow row: Int, forComponent component: Int) -> String? {
        return pickerValues[row]
    }

    func numberOfComponents(in pickerView: UIPickerView) -> Int {
        return 1
    }

    func pickerView(_ pickerView: UIPickerView, numberOfRowsInComponent component: Int) -> Int {
        return pickerValues.count
    }
}
```
